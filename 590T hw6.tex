\section{Problem 1.a}
After the algorithm terminate to show every student assign to $best(s)$ we need to show there exist no student $s_i \in S_{sad},\ S_{sad} \subseteq S$ such that $M(s_i) \not \simeq best(s_i)$ which means there cannot exist a list of available hospital $H'\subseteq H\setminus M(s_i),\ h\in H'$ such that $h\succ_{s_i} M(s_i)$ and $s_i\succ_{h} M^{-1}(h)$\\\\
There will have four cases we need to consider if it can satisfy:\\
set $h_j \in H'$\\
1: $M^{-1}(h_j) \succ_{h_j} s_i \wedge M(s_i) \succeq_{s_i} h_j$\\
2: $M^{-1}(h_j) \succ_{h_j} s_i \wedge M(s_i) \prec_{s_i} h_j$\\
3: $M^{-1}(h_j) \prec_{h_j} s_i \wedge M(s_i) \succeq_{s_i} h_j$\\
4: $M^{-1}(h_j) \prec_{h_j} s_i \wedge M(s_i) \prec_{s_i} h_j$\\\\
$(\star) best(s)$ is the hospital that s ranks highest amongst all of its valid hospitals\\\\
For both case 1 and 2:\\
if $h_j$ rank it's current student more than $s_i$ that means $h_j$ is not valid, so no matter how $s_i$ rank $h_j$, $h_j$ will stick with $M^{-1}(h_j)$. Since there are no valid hospital other $M(s_i)$ therefore base on $(\star),\ M(s_i) \simeq best(s_i)$\\
For case 3:\\
if there exist hospital that rank $s_i$ higher than it's current student but $s_i$ rank those hospital lower or equally to $M(s_i)$ which means $M(s_i)$ rank the highest amongst all the valid hospitals since there are no hospital has a higher ranking, so base on $(\star)$, $M(s_i)$ is $best(s_i)$\\
For case 4:\\
if there exist hospital that rank $s_i$ higher than it's current student and $s_i$ also rank those hospital higher than $M(s_i)$ which is a blocking pair, but this cannot happen since Gale-Shapley algorithm always return stable matching.\\\\
Overall there are no cases shows $s_i$ can get assign a hospital that is not the highest rank amongst all of it's valid hospitals.
Therefore $s$ is match to $best(s)$

\section{Problem 1.b}
In the stable match $M$ hospital $h_i$ pair with student $s^* = M^{-1}(h_i)$ if $M^{-1}(h_i) \not \simeq worst(h_i)$ that means there exist student $s,\ s^* \succ_{h_i} s$ and $(s,h_i)$ is in another stable match $M'$.\\\\
This cannot happen since in $M$ we know $s^*,h_i$ is the valid pair and base on Problem $1.a$ we know $h_i$ is $best(s^*)$.\\
Therefore in $M'$ if $h$ got match with $s$ that means $s^*$ will match with some other hospital $h_j$ and since $h_j$ got match with $s^*$ so $h_j$ is a valid hospital for $s^*$, since $h_j \not\simeq best(s^*)$, so $h_i \succeq_{s^*} h_j$.\\\\
So we will have two cases:\\
1. $s^* \succ_{h_i} s$ and $h_i \succ_{s^*} h_j$\\
2. $s^* \succ_{h_i} s$ and $h_i \simeq_{s^*} h_j$\\\\
Case $(1)$: Since we know: $s^* \succ_{h_i} s$ and $h_i \succ_{s^*} h_j$ so there will have a blocking pair.\\
Case $(2)$: Gale-Shapley algorithm don't have randomize picking, therefore $s^*$ will always pair with $h_i$ under Gale-Shapley algorithm.\\
Therefore there are no student exist that is worse than $s^*$.

\section{Problem 2.a}
Assume it is not unique stable matching which:\\
There are at least 2 students have different hospital between match $M$ and $M'$\\
Define $S_{change}$ be the set of student who has different assign hospital between match $M$ and $M'$\\
let $s$ be the highest ranking student in $S_{change}$\\
In stable matching $M$ student $s$ will pair with $h$\\
In stable matching $M'$ student $s$ will pair with $h'$\\\\
Assume $h \succ_s h'$ then we know:\\
If $M'$ happen there will have two possible reasons:\\
1. $s$ want to pair with $h$, but $h$ pair with the other student $s'$ and $h$ like $s'$ more than $s$ such that $s' \succ_h s$. So $s$ has to pair with some other hospital $h'$.\\
2. $h$ want to pair with $s$, but $s$ pair with the other hospital $h'$ and $s$ like $h'$ more than $h$ such that $h' \succeq_s h$.\\
Reason 1:\\
This cannot happen. Since for all students $s' \in S,\ s' \succ_h s$ has the same assign hospital between match $M$ and $M'$ therefore we know $h$ cannot match with $s'$.\\\\
Reason 2:\\
this cannot happen if $h' \succ_s h$. This will have 2 cases which are:\\
$a.$ $h' \succ_s h$ and $s \succ_{h'} s^*$\\
$b.$ $h' \succ_s h$ and $s^* \succ_{h'} s$\\
Case $(a)$: if this is true then in $M$, since student $s$ pair with hospital $h$: $(s,h)$ and $h'$ pair with another student $s^*$: $(s^*,h')$. This will create a blocking pair since $h' \succ_s h$, and since $s^*$ is in $S_{change}$ so $s \succ_{h'} s^*$. Therefore case $(a)$ cannot happen.\\
Case $(b)$: we know $s^* \succ_{h'} s$ cannot happen base on reason 1. Which $s$ must have higher ranking than $s^*$ and bring back to case $(a)$.\\\\
Therefore this instance is a unique stable matching since all the possible reasons to make multiple stable matching are not valid.

\section{Problem 2.b}
Base on question 1 we know:\\
$(\star)\ best(s)$ be the hospital that s ranks highest amongst all of its valid hospitals\\
$(\blackdiamond)\ worst(s)$  be the least preferred hospital that could be assigned to s under some stable matching\\
A: if student propose to hospital under G-S algorithm then student will get $best(s)$ and hospital get $worst(h)$. \\
B: if hospital propose to student under G-S algorithm then hospital will get $best(h)$ and student will get $worst(s)$.\\\\
1. Set $M_{student}$ be the stable match for student propose to hospital under G-S algorithm and base on A and $(\star)$ we know $s \in S,\ M_{student}(s) \succeq_{s} M'(s)$ where $M_{student}(s)$ is the assign hospital to student $s$ by $M_{student}$ and $M'(s)$ is the assign hospital to student $s$ by any stable match $M'$.\\\\
2. Set $M_{hospital}$ be the stable match for hospital propose to student under G-S algorithm and base on B and $(\blackdiamond)$ we know $s \in S,\ M_{hospital}(s) \preceq_s M'(s)$ where $ M_{hospital}(s)$ is the assign hospital to student s by $M_{hospital}$ and $M'(s)$ is the assign hospital to student $s$ by any stable match $M'$.\\\\
So base on 1. and 2. We know $M_{student}(s) \succeq_{s} M'(s) \succeq_{s} M_{hospital}$ where $M'(s)$ is the assign hospital to student $s$ by any stable match $M'$. Given $M_{student} = M_{hospital}$ then we got $M_{student}(s) \succeq_{s} M'(s) \succeq_{s} M_{hospital}(s) = M_{student}(s)$. Therefore $M_{student} = M'$ so the stable matching is unique.

\section{Problem 3}
The least number should be $2$ student and $2$ hospital. Because if you have $2$ student and $1$ hospital or $1$ student and $2$ hospital then one student or hospital will left out. As well as $1$ student and $1$ hospital both student and hospital only have one choice.\\\\
An example for $2$ student and $2$ hospital will be:
\begin{align*}
s_a: h_a \succ h_b \tab h_a: s_b \succ s_a\\
s_b: h_b \succ h_a \tab h_b: s_a \succ s_b
\end{align*}
Run G-S algorithm with student propose to hospital we got:
$$M:\ (s_a,h_a), (s_b,h_b)$$
Run G-S algorithm with hospital propose to student we got:
$$M':\ (s_a,h_b), (s_b,h_a)$$
Since G-S algorithm return stable matching and $M$ and $M'$ are different therefore this instance gives more than one stable matching.

 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Problem 4}
Stable matching is not always exist in this case for example:\\
$$s_a: s_b \succ s_c \succ s_d$$
$$s_b: s_c \succ s_a \succ s_d$$
$$s_c: s_a \succ s_b \succ s_d$$
$$s_d: s_a \succ s_a \succ s_c$$
We can have 3 possible matching:
$$1.\ (s_a,s_b), (s_c,s_d)$$
$$2.\ (s_a,s_c), (s_b,s_d)$$
$$3.\ (s_a,s_d), (s_b,s_c)$$
Matching $(1.)$ is not a stable matching since $s_c \succ_{s_b} s_a$ and $s_b \succ_{s_c} s_d$ therefore $s_b$ and $s_c$ prefer each other more then their current partner so it's a blocking pair.\\\\
Matching $(2.)$ is not a stable matching since $s_b \succ_{s_a} s_c$ and $s_a \succ_{s_b} s_d$ therefore $s_a$ and $s_b$ prefer each other more then their current partner so it's a blocking pair.\\\\
Matching $(3.)$ is not a stable matching since $s_c \succ_{s_a} s_d$ and $s_a \succ_{s_c} s_b$ therefore $s_a$ and $s_c$ prefer each other more then their current partner so it's a blocking pair.\\\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Problem 5.a}
Base on the question we know both $M$ and $M'$ are valid stable matching and every student $s \in S$ has to pick between $M(s)$ and $M'(s)$ therefore we know every student will have a hospital to pair with.\\\\
To make sure this the out put is a stable matching we have to make sure: 
1. there are no student causing a blocking pair.
2. There exist no student pair with two hospitals or a hospital pair with two students.\\\\
1.\\
Assume the match from $M\lor M'$ has $(s,h)$ and there exist a student $s_i$ that he prefer $h \succ_{s_i}M\lor M'(s_i)$ and $h$ prefer $s_i$ more than $s$ as well. Since $(s,h)$ happen therefore we know it's either in $M$ or $M'$ and since $s_i$ want $h$ more than the option in $M$ and $M'$ which will create a blocking pair in the match where $(s,h)$ at. Since both $M$ and $M'$ are stable matching, therefore this situation cannot happen.\\\\
2.\\
For example $M\lor M'(s) = h$ and $M\lor M'(h) = s'$ cannot happen, because this situation create a blocking pair.\\
Base on the example we know there will have two possible pair: $(s,h)$ and $(s',h)$. Since we know $M$ and $M'$ both are stable matching therefore $(s,h)$ is happen in either $M$ or $M'$ and $(s',h)$ is happen in the other one.\\\\
Since we know $M \lor M'(h)$ is $h$ less preferred student between $M$ and $M'$ therefore $s \succ_h s'$.\\
We also know $M\lor M'(s)$ is $s$ more preferred hospital between $M$ and $M'$ therefore $h \succ_s h'$\\
Since $s \succ_h s'$ and $h \succ_s h'$ therefore $M\lor M'(s) = h$ and $M\lor M'(h) = s'$ cannot happen.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Problem 5.b}
 $M \geq M'$ or $M' \geq M$ is not true. For example:\\
\begin{align*}
s_1: h_2 \succ h_1 \succ h_3 \succ h_4 \tab h_1: s_1 \succ s_2 \succ s_3 \succ s_4\\
s_2: h_1 \succ h_2 \succ h_3 \succ h_4 \tab h_2: s_2 \succ s_1 \succ s_3 \succ s_4\\
s_3: h_3 \succ h_4 \succ h_1 \succ h_2 \tab h_3: s_4 \succ s_3 \succ s_1 \succ s_2\\
s_4: h_4 \succ h_3 \succ h_1 \succ h_2 \tab h_4: s_3 \succ s_4 \succ s_1 \succ s_2\\
\end{align*}
Base on this instance we define:\\ 
$$M = (s_1,h_2)(s_2,h_1)(s_3,h_4)(s_4,h_3)$$
$$M' = (s_1,h_1)(s_2,h_2)(s_3,h_3)(s_4,h_4)$$\\
$M$ is a stable matching since $s_1, s_2, h_3, h_4$ got their first choice. And both $s_3,s_4$ prefer $h_3,h_4$ more than $h_1,h_2$ therefore $M$ is a stable matching since there are no blocking pair.\\\\
$M'$ is a stable matching since $s_3, s_4, h_1, h_2$ got their first choice. And both $s_1,s_2$ prefer $h_1,h_2$ more than $h_3,h_4$ therefore $M$ is a stable matching since there are no blocking pair.\\\\
So base on $M$ and $M'$ we know $s_1,s_2$ prefer $M$ and $s_3,s_4$ prefer $M'$ therefore $M \geq M'$ or $M' \geq M$ is not true.

\section{Problem 5.c}
$M_{student}$ be the stable match of student propose to hospital under G-S algorithm.\\
$M_{hospital}$ be the stable match of hospital propose to student under G-S algorithm.\\\\
Define $C$ be the set of all stable matching.\\
set $M' \in C\setminus M_{hospital}$ be the lowest one from student perspective such that $\forall M \in C\setminus (M',M_{hospital}),\ M \succeq_s M'$.\\\\
Base on lattice structure $M \lor M'$ student will always pick the better one. \\Therefore the best case scenario will be $M^* \lor M_{student},\ M^* \in C$. Since $M_{student}$ return $best(s)$, so there are no stable match that is better than $M_{student}$. And base on the definition of $M \lor M'$ the outcome of  $M^* \lor M_{student}$ will be $M_{student}$.\\\\
The worst case scenario will be $M' \lor M_{hospital}$. Since $M_{hospital}$ return the $worst(s)$, so there are no stable match that is worst than $M_{hospital}$. And base on the definition of $M \lor M'$ the outcome of  $M' \lor M_{hospital}$ will be $M'$.
